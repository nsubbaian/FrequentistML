# NMF

NMF project is to select a dataset and use the out of the box sci-kit learn to build a recommendation system. 

Here's a list of possible datasets:

Note, you should make sure that the dataset is appropriate for a NMF based rec system. Use your system to output some recommendations for a user or two.
A stretch goal for those of you feeling more ambitious would be to implement a version of NMF yourself. The version in sci-kit has a more robust loss function and therefore needs fancier solvers, but a vanilla NMF can be implemented pretty easily using an alternate least squares approach, which we will discuss in class.
