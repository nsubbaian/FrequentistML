# Assignment 4: xTreme Gradient Boosted Trees

Read sections: 9.2, all of chapter 10 (sorry) and https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.02754v3.pdf

Select a dataset for either classification or regression. It can be the same dataset as the one you used in the previous assignments, or a new one. Use an out of the box package for xTreme gradient boosting trees such as https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.
Don’t use sci-kit’s gradient boosting method because there is no regularization built in (this is a key difference between gradient boosting and xTreme).
Use the same 80-10-10 split to tune your classifier/regression method and report your performance and output the feature importance. 

Do the features reported make sense? If you are using the same dataset from assignment 1 or 2, do they agree with what you discovered using the Lasso penalty?
